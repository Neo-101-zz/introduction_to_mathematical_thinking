PROBLEMS

1
(a) 0 < π < 10
(b) 7 <= p < 12
(c) 5 < x < 7
(d) x < 4
(e) -3 < y < 3
(f) x = 0

2
(a) π is greater than 0 and less than 10
(b) p is greater than or equal to 7 and less than 12
(c) x is greater than 5 and less than 7
(d) x is less than 4
(e) y is greater than -3 and less than 3
(f) y is equal to 0

3
Check whether φ1, φ2, ..., φn is all true.

4
Check whether any of φ1, φ2, ..., φn is false.

5
(a) π > 3
(b) x ≠ 0
(c) x >= 0
(d) x >= 0
(e) (x < -3) ∨ (x > 3)

6
(a) π is greater than 3
(b) x is not equal to 0
(c) x is greater than or equal to 0
(d) x is greater than or equal to 0
(e) x is less than -3 or greater than 3

7
Check whether any of φ1, φ2, ..., φn is true.

8
Check whether φ1, φ2, ..., φn is all false.

9
(a) π <= 3.2
(b) x >= 0
(c) x = 0
(d) x ≠ 1
(e) ψ

10
(a) π is less than or equal to 3.2
(b) x is greater than or equal to 0
(c) x is equal to 0
(d) x is not equal to 0
(e) ψ

11
(a) D ∧ Y
(b) T ∧ (¬Y) ∧ D
(c) (D ∧ (¬Y)) ∧ ((¬D) ∧ Y)     [WRONG]
    ¬(D ∧ Y)                    [CORRECT]
    (D ∧ (¬Y)) ∨ ((¬D) ∧ Y)     [CORRECT]
    because if one of (D ∧ (¬Y)) and ((¬D) ∧ Y) is true, it means ¬(D ∧ Y) is true.
(d) T ∧ (¬D) ∧ (¬Y)
(e) (¬T) ∧ D ∧ Y

TWO TO THINK ABOUT AND DISCUS WITH OTHER STUDENTS

1
This state of affairs is not captured acccurately when we use "not" in mathematical sense.
Because in mathematical sense, "¬guilty" means truly not guilty, 
not the meaning of not proven guilty in this case.
"Not proven" and "¬proven" mean the same in the case that 
it refers to the proving state of prosecution, which means the prosecution fails to prove guilt.
"Not proven" and "¬proven" don not mean the same in the case that 
it refers to the law case itself. 
Because the prosecution failing to prove guilt is not equal to the fact that 
the defendant can not been prove guilt.

2
individual judgement is very subjective, and vary a large extent.
In this case, we can set the judgement of a movie as a number with 3 values: -1, 0 and 1, 
which mean "displeased", "sort of" and "pleased" respectively.
So, "not displeased" is not equal to "pleased" just like >=(-1) is not equal to 1.
There is a state naming "sort of" between them.
