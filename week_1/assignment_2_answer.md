(a) π is greater than 0 and less than 10<br/>
(b) p is greater than or equal to 7 and less than 12<br/>
(c) x is greater than 5 and less than 7<br/>
(d) x is less than 4<br/>
(e) y is greater than -3 and less than 3<br/>
(f) y is equal to 0<br/>

Check whether φ1, φ2, ..., φn is all true.<br/>

(a) π > 3<br/>
(b) x ≠ 0<br/>
(c) x >= 0<br/>
(d) x >= 0<br/>
(e) (x < -3) ∨ (x > 3)<br/>

(a) π is greater than 3<br/>
(b) x is not equal to 0<br/>
(c) x is greater than or equal to 0<br/>
(d) x is greater than or equal to 0<br/>
(e) x is less than -3 or greater than 3<br/>

Check whether any of φ1, φ2, ..., φn is true.<br/>

8<br/>
Check whether φ1, φ2, ..., φn is all false.<br/>

(a) π <= 3.2<br/>
(b) x >= 0<br/>
(c) x = 0<br/>
(d) x ≠ 1<br/>
(e) ψ<br/>

10<br/>
(a) π is less than or equal to 3.2<br/>
(b) x is greater than or equal to 0<br/>
(c) x is equal to 0<br/>
(d) x is not equal to 0<br/>
(e) ψ<br/>

(a) D ∧ Y<br/>
(b) T ∧ (¬Y) ∧ D<br/>
(c) (D ∧ (¬Y)) ∧ ((¬D) ∧ Y)     **WRONG**<br/>
​    ¬(D ∧ Y)                             **CORRECT**<br/>
​    (D ∧ (¬Y)) ∨ ((¬D) ∧ Y)     **CORRECT**<br/>
​    because if one of (D ∧ (¬Y)) and ((¬D) ∧ Y) is true, it means ¬(D ∧ Y) is true.<br/>
(d) T ∧ (¬D) ∧ (¬Y)<br/>
(e) (¬T) ∧ D ∧ Y<br/>

#### TWO TO THINK ABOUT AND DISCUS WITH OTHER STUDENTS

1<br/>
This state of affairs is not captured acccurately when we use "not" in mathematical sense.<br/>
Because in mathematical sense, "¬guilty" means truly not guilty, <br/>
not the meaning of not proven guilty in this case.<br/>
"Not proven" and "¬proven" mean the same in the case that <br/>
it refers to the proving state of prosecution, which means the prosecution fails to prove guilt.<br/>
"Not proven" and "¬proven" don not mean the same in the case that <br/>
it refers to the law case itself. <br/>
Because the prosecution failing to prove guilt is not equal to the fact that <br/>
the defendant can not been prove guilt.<br/>

2<br/>
individual judgement is very subjective, and vary a large extent.<br/>
In this case, we can set the judgement of a movie as a number with 3 values: -1, 0 and 1, <br/>
which mean "displeased", "sort of" and "pleased" respectively.<br/>
So, "not displeased" is not equal to "pleased" just like >=(-1) is not equal to 1.<br/>
There is a state naming "sort of" between them.<br/>
